    <h2>
      A skateboard is a type of sports equipment used for skateboarding. They
      are usually made of a specially designed 7-8 ply maple plywood deck and
      polyurethane wheels attached to the underside by a pair of skateboarding
      trucks. The skateboarder moves by pushing with one foot while the other
      foot remains balanced on the board, or by pumping one's legs in structures
      such as a bowl or half pipe. A skateboard can also be used by simply
      standing on the deck while on a downward slope and allowing gravity to
      propel the board and rider. If the rider's leading foot is their right
      foot, they are said to ride "goofy;" if the rider's leading foot is their
      left foot, they are said to ride "regular." If the rider is normally
      regular but chooses to ride goofy (or vice versa), they are said to be
      riding in "switch". A skater is typically more comfortable pushing with
      their back foot; choosing to push with the front foot is commonly referred
      to as riding "mongo", and has negative connotations of style and
      effectiveness in the skateboarding community.
