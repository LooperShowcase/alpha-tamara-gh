          a.k.a. "quad skates", are shoes or bindings that fit onto shoes that
          are worn to enable the wearer to roll along on wheels. The first
          roller skate was effectively an ice skate with wheels replacing the
          blade. Later the "quad" style of roller skate became more popular
          consisting of four wheels arranged in the same configuration as a
          typical car. Roller skating is a hobby, sport, and mode of
          transportation using roller skates.

        A skateboard is a type of sports equipment used for skateboarding. They
        are usually made of a specially designed 7-8 ply maple plywood deck and
        polyurethane wheels attached to the underside by a pair of skateboarding
        trucks. The skateboarder moves by pushing with one foot while the other
        foot remains balanced on the board, or by pumping one's legs in
        structures such as a bowl or half pipe. A skateboard can also be used by
        simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope and allowing
        gravity to propel the board and rider. If the rider's leading foot is
        their right foot, they are said to ride "goofy;" if the rider's leading
        foot is their left foot, they are said to ride "regular." If the rider
        is normally regular but chooses to ride goofy (or vice versa), they are
        said to be riding in "switch". A skater is typically more comfortable
        pushing with their back foot; choosing to push with the front foot is
        commonly referred to as riding "mongo", and has negative connotations of
        style and effectiveness in the skateboarding community.

      <h5>
        Ice skates are metal blades attached underfoot and used to propel the
        bearer across a sheet of ice while ice skating. The first ice skates
        were made from leg bones of horse, ox or deer, and were attached to feet
        with leather straps. These skates required a pole with a sharp metal
        spike that was used for pushing the skater forward, unlike modern bladed
        skates.[1] Modern skates come in many different varieties, which are
        chosen depending on the nature of the requirements needed for the
        skating activity. They are worn recreationally in ice rinks or on frozen
        bodies of water across the globe and are used as footwear in many
        sports, including figure skating, bandy, ice hockey, ringette, rink
        bandy, rinkball, speed skating and tour skating.
